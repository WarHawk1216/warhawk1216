						<h4>Discourses and Selected Writings <i>&mdash;Epictetus</i></h4>
						<div style="padding-bottom: 200px;"><a
								href="https://www.amazon.ca/Discourses-Selected-Writings-Epictetus/dp/0140449469"><img
									src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/manraj-brar/Site/main/images/Discourses.jpg"
									style="border:1px solid grey;" width="150" height="200" /></a>
							<p style="text-indent: 30px; padding-left: 175px;">A collection of writings and
								conversations between Epictetus and his academy, which were recorded by his student
								Arrian. Epictetus was an early stoic also responsible for the writing of the
								Enchiridion.</p>
							<br>
							<p style="text-indent: 30px; padding-left: 175px;">Discourses is an anthology of practical
								philosophical teachings which are meant to be employed in one's life, as taught by
								Epictetus. Some of my favourite Stoic teachings are present in this this book. One of
								which is an anecdote of Diogenes:</p>
							<br>
							<p style="padding-left: 245px;"><i>How we should struggle with circumstance</i> "[6]
								Diogenes went scouting before you did and came back with a very different report. Death,
								he said, was note evil becuase it was not dishonourable. Reputation was the empty noise
								of fools. [7] And he said other things that helped remove the elemenet of fear from pain
								and poverty. In his manner of life he preferred the minimum of clothing to a purple
								gown, and the bare ground to a bed, however soft. [8] And as proof of such claims, he
								produced his assurance, his serenity, his freedom - as well as his tough, radiant
								physique."</p>

						<h4>The Denial of Death <i>&mdash;Ernest Becker</i></h4>
						<div style="padding-bottom: 200px;"><a href="https://a.co/d/7Ho3xtE"><img
									src="https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/manraj-brar/Site/main/images/DenialofDeath.jpg"
									style="border:1px solid grey;" width="150" height="200" /></a>
							<p style="text-indent: 30px; padding-left: 175px;">This is one of my favourite, if not
								favourite, books ever written. Despite many psychologists, philosophers, academics, and
								the like crowd claiming that Becker is wrong, the book still stands as a testament to
								Becker's amazing capability to synthesize subjects otherwise loosely related into a very
								compelling and cohesive piece of work which aims to 'solve,' or discusses the potential
								of solving, the problem of living and dying. I began reading the book because I was
								familiar with the existentialist philosopher SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard (one of the most
								brilliant philosophers I have ever come across) and through some research learned that Becker's book was somewhat
								of an expansion on Kierkegaard's ideas. What it was in actuality was far more than such,
								it was a composure consisting of numerous texts and ideas that originate from the (at
								times) opposing fields of philosophy and psychology; somewhat of an irony regarding this is
								that Carl Jung, who's mentioned occasionaly, had a distaste for philosophy and Kierkegaard in
								particular. I will definetely be reading this book again in a year or two because one
								reading is not enough to understand Becker's thought in its entirety.</p>
							<br>
							<p style="text-indent: 30px; padding-left: 175px;">My opinion on Becker's book is that, if
								you couldn't tell above, that he's more or less right about his existential perspective
								on psychoanalysis and the state of the 'modern man.' I'll leave the details out in
								avoidance of spoilers but I'll include a few quotes that I took interest in below: </p>
